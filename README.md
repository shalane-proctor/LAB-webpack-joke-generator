# Joke Generator
## Starting the Project
1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application.
1. Rename the `.sample.env` file to `.env` file. The final file name should be `.env`
1. Navigate to the `index.html ` file and change the title to "Joke Generator"
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. To start your application, run `npm start`

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. When a user first loads the app, a button appears on the DOM that reads "Get a Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get a Joke" button, an API call is made to the joke API and the joke setup appears on the DOM.
1. When a user presses the "Get a Joke" button, the button text changes to "Get Punchline"
1. When a user presses the "Get Punchline" button, both the joke setup and delivery are on the DOM along with a button that reads "Get Another Joke"
1. When the user presses the "Get Another Joke" button, the app starts over from step 3.
